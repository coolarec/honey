[Live demo](https://dani3l0.github.io/honey)

A sweet dashboard hosted on my homeserver with some self-hosted stuff...

# Installation
Just put those files at the webroot of your server tweak the `config.json` file located in `config` directory!

honey is written in **pure** `HTML` `CSS` `JS` so dynamic backend is not required. All operations are done client-side.
