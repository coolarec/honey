This will be a dashboard hosted on my homeserver with self-hosted stuff. But, for now...

**work in progress**

#### Still to do before prod:

- [ ] External config loaded with XHR (app list)
- [ ] Apply config for the rest stuff (data shown in More page, default user settings)
- [ ] Make 'Security' module functional
- [ ] Security screen on/off
- [ ] CSS global color variables for easier theming
- [ ] Fix blur flicker on showing/hiding pages
- [ ] Open in new tab setting
- [ ] Better icon colors in 'More' page
- [ ] Minor code optimizations

blah blah blah
