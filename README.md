# honey

A sweet dashboard hosted on my homeserver with some self-hosted stuff...

# Installation
Just put those files at the webroot of your server and **copy `defaults.json` to `config.json`** in `config` directory.

honey is written in **pure** `HTML` `CSS` `JS` so dynamic backend is not required. All operations are done client-side.
